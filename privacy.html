					<p>Scottie Technologies Limited, is a company registered in Scotland (company number SC612882) having its registered office at 42 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, EH2 4HQ ("Scottie", "we" or "us").</p>
					 
					<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. This privacy policy gives you information on how we collect and process your personal data as a customer of our services. This privacy policy does not relate to personal data about end users of our services. If you are an end user of one of our customers and want to know how a customer handles your personal data, you should check its privacy policy. Please read the following carefully to ensure that you fully understand how and why we are using your personal data.</p>
					
					<h4>Contact details</h4>
					<p>Scottie Technologies is the data controller responsible for your personal data. If you have any questions, comments or requests regarding this privacy policy or our data protection practices, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@scottie.io:">privacy@scottie.io</a> or +44 (0)20 8050 4952.</p>
					 
					<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (<a href="www.ico.org.uk" target="_blank">ico.org.uk</a>). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
					 
					<h4>Third-party links</h4>
					
					<p>Our services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of participant organisations, our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal information to these websites.</p>

					<h4>Personal data we may collect from you</h4>
					<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).</p>

					<p>We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Identity Data: your name and title.</li>
						<li>Contact Data: your address, email address and telephone numbers.</li>
						<li>Profile Data: any feedback, complaints or survey responses you send us.</li>
						<li>Usage Data: information about how you use our services.</li>
						<li>Technical Data: your internet protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, time zone setting and location, browser plug-in type, operating system, and other technology on the devices you use to access our services.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>We collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific service feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
					 
					<p>We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>

					<h4>How your personal data is collected</h4>

						<li>Contact us by phone, email, social media or otherwise;</li>
						<li>Submit feedback to us on our website or service.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>As you interact with our services, we will automatically collect Technical Data about your equipment, browsing actions and patterns. We collect this personal data by using cookies and other similar technologies, from analytics providers such as Google.</p>

					<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can visit the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu on your browser to change these settings. You have the option to accept cookies, to be notified when a cookie is issued or refuse cookies. </p>

					<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. Generally, we will keep personal data which we collect for up to three (3) years after you cease using our services, for any of the purposes mentioned above. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>

					<h4>International Transfers</h4>
					<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

					<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Where we use certain service providers, we use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
							<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Please see the below table for further information on the specific safeguard used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA:</p>

					<h4>Your Rights</h4>
					
					<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. This includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li> 
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
						<li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</li>
						<ul>
							<li style="margin-left:2em">If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
							<li style="margin-left:2em">Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
							<li style="margin-left:2em">Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li> 
							<li style="margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:1em">You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
						</ul>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom:1em"><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@scottie.io">privacy@scottie.io</a> or on +44 (0)20 8050 4952.</p>

					<h4>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4> 
					
					<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
					 
					<h4>Changes to your personal data</h4>
					
					<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>
